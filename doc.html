<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>When a stock price trades directionally at the open, does it keep going?  Does the price movement retrace?  And are there regular times during the day which 
exhibit behavior correlated with the open? This application produces graphical output which allows the user to explore an ensemble of daily price movements of a selected stock to visually look for daily patterns.  It
is intended to be an exploratory tool used as a prelude to more detailed  inferential methods.</p>

<p> The application uses an undocumented Google Finance API for intraday 
prices called getprices.  There are some independently collected tidbits on this 
API <a href="http://www.networkerror.org/component/content/article/1-technical-wootness/44-googles-undocumented-finance-api.html" target="_blank">here.</a>It is provided as an exploratory class project only. No warranty is expressed or 
implied;  nor does this application comprise actionable investment advice.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>Given the symbol of a stock trading on the NYSE or NASDAQ, the application 
will sample daily price movements at configurable bar intervals (10, 15 or 30 minutes) and plot price and volume profiles overlaid from up to 28 previous trading days. (Note: "bar" is a common term for financial time series data 
aggregated over time intervals.  Bars typically contain a price at the beginning
of the interval called the opening price, a price at the end of the interval 
known as the closing price, high and low prices attained during the interval, 
and volume of shares traded during the interval.  Here is the definition 
of "bar" at <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bar.asp" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>).</p>

<p>The stock must be a valid symbol trading on NYSE or NASDAQ.  If an invalid symbol is given, the application should display a message to the effect that no data was returned.  Alternately if the symbol trades very lightly or has
non-standard trading times, the application should display a message to the 
effect that some data was missing.</p>

<p>Pro tips: </p>
<ui>
  <li>This is hooked up to a live internet feed.  Be patient and allow data to load.</li>    
  <li>More days and smaller intervals mean larger data sets and longer load times.</li>
  <li>If something goes awry, keep calm, try closing the browser window and reloading.</li>
  <li>Some example stocks to try out: GOOG, AAPL, XOM, T, P.</li>

<h4>Output</h4>

<h4>Price/Volume Tab</h4>

<p>The top plot shows daily price movements tracked in minutes after the standard
9:30 US/Eastern open.  Tool tips displaying point data are available by mousing
over selected data points in the plot.  Data from a particular day can be 
excluded by clicking on that day in the legend, while data from a particular day can be shown exclusively by double-clicking on that day.</p>

<p>The bottom plot shows daily volume tracked in minutes after the standard 9:30 US/Eastern open.  Tool tips displaying point data are available by mousing
over selected regions in the bar plot.  Data from a particular day can be 
excluded by clicking on that day in the legend, while data from a particular day can be shown exclusively by double-clicking on that day.</p>

<p>An additional option for this tab controls whether the prices/volumes are displayed as-is, or are expressed in % change from the opening period.</p>

<h4>Correlations Tab</h4>

<p>The top plot shows two correlation profiles.  The profile on the left
("Rolling") shows the correlation of the price movement of the reference bar
period with each other bar period in a trading day.  For example, when the 
reference bar is chosen to be the opening bar, the "rolling" plot is showing the 
correlation of the opening price movement with subsequent price movements through the day.</p>

<p>The plot on the right ("Fixed") shows the correlation of price movement in
the reference bar with the cumulative price movement at each point during the 
day. For example, when the reference bar is chosen to be the opening bar, the "fixed" plot is showing the correlation of the opening price movement with the overall cumulative price movement through the day.</p>

<p>An additional option for this tab allows the user to choose the reference 
bar, and explore how the correlation profiles change as the reference bar is 
varied.</p>
